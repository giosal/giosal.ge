            <h3 id="headline">Here's the timeline of Ilia Chavchavadze's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>November 8, 1837</strong> - Born in Kvareli, Georgia Governorate, Russian Empire (present day Kakheti, Georgia)</li>
                <li><strong>1848</strong> - After the death of his mother, sent by his father to Tbilisi to start his secondary education</li>
                <li><strong>1851</strong> - Entered the 1<sup>st</sup> Academy of Tbilisi</li>
                <li><strong>1857</strong> - Admitted to University of Saint Petersburg</li>
                <li><strong>1861</strong> - Completed his studies and returned to Georgia. During his journey back, Ilia wrote one of his greatest masterpieces, The Traveler's Diaries, in ;which he outlines the importance of nation-building and provides an allegorical comparison of Mt. Kazbegi and the Tergi River in the Khevi region of Georgia.</li>
                <li><strong>1861-1907</strong> - Ilia's main political and social goals were based on Georgian nationalism. He urged nationwide resistance to the House of Romanov's policy of forced Russification, the revival of the Georgian language, and the cultivation of Georgian literature. Even more subversive from the State's perspective, Chavchavadze also pushed for reviving the independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church from the control of the Tsar and the Holy Synod and, most subversively, for Georgia's political independence. Both of these things had ended when Georgia had become part of the Russian Empire.</li>
                <li><strong>1906-1907</strong> - Member of State Council of Russia</li>
                <li><strong>August 28, 1907</strong> - Ambushed and murdered with his wife by six assassins in Tsitsamuri, near Mtskheta</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As a result of Prince Chavchavadze's death, the Georgian Social Democrats, especially the Mensheviks, started to gain significant power and support among the Georgian people. Eventually, after the temporary disengagement of Russia from Transcaucasia, Georgian Mensheviks decided to revive Georgian statehood and proclaimed the independence on 26 May 1918. After the Soviet invasion of Georgia and the nation's annexation into the Soviet Union in 1921, Chavchavadze became for Georgian nationalists the symbol of Georgian freedom and national liberation.</p>
